If you are looking for a quick answer and you can't find what you're looking for in the docs, come ask in our IRC chat room.  While there is typically somebody there who can answer your question, please remember that #sailsjs is 100% community maintained. That means that help is given at the discretion of the community.  For best results, be polite and to the point.  

If you've never been on IRC, now is the perfect time.  Getting started is easy.
