# Contributing to Sails

This guide is designed to help you get off the ground quickly contributing to Sails.  Reading it thoroughly will help you write useful issues, make eloquent proposals, and submit top-notch code that can be merged quickly.  Respecting the guidelines laid out below helps make the core maintainers of Sails more productive, and makes the experience of working with Sails positive and enjoyable for the community at large.

If you are working on a pull request, **please carefully read this file from top to bottom**. In case of doubt, open an issue in the issue tracker or contact someone from our [core team](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails#team) on Twitter. Especially do so if you plan to work on something big. Nothing is more frustrating than seeing your hard work go to waste because your vision does not align with planned or ongoing development efforts of the project's maintainers.
