# Getting Started

## Installation
To install the latest stable release with the command-line tool:

	sudo npm -g install sails

On Windows (or Mac OS with Homebrew), you don't need sudo:

	npm -g install sails

## Creating a New Sails Project
Create a new app:

	sails new testProject

Now lift the server:

	cd testProject
	sails lift

At this point, if you visit (http://localhost:1337/) you will see the default home page.

Now, let's get Sails to do cool stuff.
