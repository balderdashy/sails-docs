# Database Support
> _Note: You are viewing the Sails.js v0.9.x documentation.  If you're looking for information on v0.8.x, please visit [here](http://08x.sailsjs.org)._

Sails uses [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) as its ORM, and supports all databases which have waterline adapters:

- [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/particlebanana/sails-postgresql) - *0.9+ compatible* - `sails-postgresql`
- [MySQL](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mysql) - *0.9+ compatible* - `sails-mysql`
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mongo) - *0.9+ compatible* - `sails-mongo`
- [Memory](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-memory) - *0.9+ compatible* - `sails-memory`
- [Disk](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-disk) - *0.9+ compatible* - `sails-disk`

## Developing Custom Adapters

If the database you need isn't listed above, you can help contribute to an existing project or create your own.
Check out https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/wiki/custom-adapters to learn more about that.

## In-Progress Community Adapters

  - [Redis](https://github.com/vanetix/sails-redis)
  - [Riak](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-riak)
  - [Couch](https://github.com/craveprogramminginc/sails-couchdb)


## Other Community Adapters
Also, adapters are not limited to databases.  The Sails.js ORM (Waterline) can be hooked up to communiate with any asynchronous web service! 
Web services like LDAP, Active Directory, and even things like Twitter and Facebook can be accessed via the ORM through adapters.
You can get pretty avante garde here.
