# Tutorials

Here you can find step-by-step guides for dealing with a few specific Sails use cases. There's a wealth of great information and tutorials about Sails across the web; these are just a few that have been personally vetted by members of the core team.  Currently, the objective of this section of the docs is to cover some less common scenarios that users have asked about, but that would add unnecessary complexity to the reference & conceptual documentation if they were included there. In the future, we hope to also address some common _"How do I ...?"_ questions that we hear from newcomers to the framework.

If you have a use case you would like to see addressed here, and/or are interested in writing a tutorial yourself, we appreciate your input! Just take a look at our [contribution guide](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing) if you haven't already, then open an issue in the [`sails-docs`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/issues/new) repo with a proposal for the tutorial you'd like to see/write.
