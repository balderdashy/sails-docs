# .subscribe()

Subscribes the requesting client socket to one or more database records (i.e. model instances).  

### Usage

```js
SomeModel.subscribe(req, ids);
```

_-or-_

```js
SomeModel.subscribe(req, ids, contexts);
```

By default (if no "contexts" are provided), the client socket will receive relevant messages emitted by `.publishUpdate()`, `.publishDestroy()`, `.publishAdd()` and `.publishRemove()`.

> **Important**:
>
> This function does _not actually talk to the database_!  In fact, none of the resourceful pubsub methods do.  These are just a simplified abstraction layer built on top of the lower-level `sails.sockets` methods, designed to make your app cleaner and easier to debug by using conventional names for events/rooms/namespaces etc.


|   | Argument   | Type         | Details |
|---|------------|:------------:|---------|
| 1 | `req`      | ((req))   | The request object (`req`).  You should only use this method from an action.
| 2 | `ids`      | ((array))        | An array of record ids (primary keys).
| 3 | `contexts` | ((array)) | An optional array of change-type strings ("contexts").  If provided, the subscribing client socket will only receive messages involving the specified types of changes (e.g. if a "destroy" context is specified, the socket will receive notifications from `publishDestroy()` calls involving this record).  Otherwise, if left unspecified, the socket will hear about any published events involving this record.


*Note*: `subscribe` will only work with requests made over a socket.io connection (e.g. using `io.socket.get()`), *not* over an http connection (e.g. using `jQuery.get()`).  See the [sails.io.js socket client documentation](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/web-sockets/socket-client) for information on using client sockets to send WebSockets/Socket.io messages with Sails.


### Example

```javascript
  subscribeToLouies: function (req, res) {
    if (!req.isSocket) {
      return res.badRequest('Only a client socket can subscribe to Louies.  You, sir, appear to be something... _else_.');
    }
    
    // Let's say our client socket has a problem with people named "louie".
    
    // First we'll find all users named "louie" (or "louis" even-- we should be thorough)
    User.find({ or: [{name: 'louie'},{name: 'louis'}] }).exec(function(err, usersNamedLouie){
      if (err) {
        return res.negotiate(err);
      }
      
      // Now we'll use the ids we found to subscribe our client socket to each of these records'
      // "destroy" context.
      User.subscribe(req, _.pluck(usersNamedLouie, 'id'), ['destroy']);
      
      // Now any time a user named "louie" or "louis" is destroyed, our client socket will receive
      // a notification (as long as it stays connected anyways).
      
      // All done!  We could send down some data, but instead we send an empty response.
      // (although we're ok telling this vengeful client socket when our users get
      //  destroyed, it seems ill-advised to send him our Louies' sensitive user data.
      //  We don't want to help this guy to hunt them down irl.)
      return res.ok();
    });
  }
```


### Blueprints and .subscribe()

By default, the blueprint `find` and `findOne` actions will call `.subscribe()` to subscribe a requesting socket to all returned records.  However, the blueprint `update` and `delete` actions will *not* cause a message to be sent to the requesting socket by default--only to the *other* connected sockets.  This is intended to allow the caller of `io.socket.update()` (for example) to use the client-side SDK's callback to handle the server response separately.  To force the blueprint actions to send messages to all sockets, *including the requesting socket*, set `sails.config.blueprints.mirror` to `true`.

### What is `context`?

If you specify a specific *context* (or array of contexts) to subscribe to, you will only get messages sent in that context.  For example, `User.subscribe(socket, user, 'update')` will cause the socket to receive messages only when `publishUpdate` is called for `user`.  Subsequent calls to `subscribe` are cumulative, so if you called `User.subscribe(socket, user, 'destroy')` later with the same socket, that socket would then be subscribed to messages from both `publishUpdate` and `publishDestroy`.  

You can omit `context` to subscribe a socket to the default contexts for that model class.  The default contexts are defined by the `autosubscribe` property of the model class.  If `autosubscribe` is not present, then the default contexts are `update`, `destroy`, `message` (for custom messages), `add:*` and `remove:*` (publishAdd and publishRemove messages for associated models).
