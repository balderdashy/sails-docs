# .destroyOne()

Destroy the record in your database that matches the given criteria, if one exists.

```usage
var destroyedRecord = await Something.destroyOne(criteria);
```

> Before attempting to modify the database, Waterline will check to see if the given criteria would match more than one record and, if so, it will throw an error instead of proceeding.


### Usage

|   |     Argument        | Type              | Details                            |
|---|:--------------------|-------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| 1 | criteria            | ((dictionary))    | The [Waterline criteria](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/query-language) to use for matching the record in the database.

##### Result

| Type                | Description      |
|:--------------------|:-----------------|
| ((dictionary?))     | Since this method never destroys more than one record, if a record is destroyed then it is always provided as a result.  Otherwise, this returns `undefined`.


##### Errors

See [Concepts > Models and ORM > Errors](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/errors) for examples of negotiating errors in Sails and Waterline.


### Example

```javascript
var burnedBook = await User.destroyOne({id: 4})
if (burnedBook) {
  sails.log('Deleted book with `id: 4`.');
} else {
  sails.log('The database does not have a book with `id: 4`.');
}
```


### Notes
> + This method **does not support .fetch()** -- because it _always_ returns the destroyed record, if one was matched.
> + This method can be used with [`await`](https://github.com/mikermcneil/parley/tree/49c06ee9ed32d9c55c24e8a0e767666a6b60b7e8#usage), promise chaining, or [traditional Node callbacks](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/waterline-orm/queries/exec).
