# .fetch()

Tell Waterline (and the underlying database adapter) to send back records that were updated/destroyed/created when performing an [`.update()`](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/waterline-orm/models/update), [`.create()`](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/waterline-orm/models/create), [`.createEach()`](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/waterline-orm/models/create-each) or [`.destroy()`](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/waterline-orm/models/destroy) query.  Otherwise, no data will be returned (or if you are using callbacks, the second argument to the `.exec()` callback will be `undefined`.)

> Warning: This is not recommended for update/destroy queries that affect large numbers of records.
