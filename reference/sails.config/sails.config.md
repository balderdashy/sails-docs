# Configuration (`sails.config`)

The `sails.config` objectÂ contains the runtime values of [your app's configuration](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/configuration). It is assembled automatically when Sails loads your app; merging together command-line arguments, environment variables, your `.sailsrc` file, and the configuration objects exported from any and all modules in your app's [`config/`](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/anatomy/config) directory.

For more general info about how to configure your Sails app, see the [configuration concepts guide](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/configuration).  See the other pages in this reference section for details on the configuration files that come with every new Sails app, or read about [custom configuration](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/configuration/sails-config-custom).
