# sails.config.sockets
### What is this?
These configuration options provide transparent access to Socket.io, the WebSocket/pubsub server encapsulated by Sails.

### Commonly-Used Options

  Property      | Type       | Default  | Details |
 ---------------|------------|----------|---------|
 `onConnect`    |((function))| see [config/sockets.js](http://beta.sailsjs.org/#/documentation/anatomy/myApp/config/sockets.js.html)  | A function to run every time a new client-side socket connects to the server.
 `onDisconnect` |((function))| see [config/sockets.js](http://beta.sailsjs.org/#/documentation/anatomy/myApp/config/sockets.js.html)  | A function to run every time a new client-side socket disconnects from the server.
 `adapter`      |((string))  |`'memory'`| The database where socket.io will store its message queue and answer pubsub logic.  Can be set to either `'memory'` or `'redis'`
 `host`         |((string))  |`'127.0.0.1'` | Hostname of your redis instance (only applicable if using the redis socket store adapter)
 `port`         |((integer)) |`6379`   | Port of your redis instance (only applicable if using the redis socket store adapter)
 `db`           |((string))  |`'sails'`   | The name of the database to use within your redis instance (only applicable if using the redis socket store adapter)
 `pass`         | ((string)) | ((undefined)) | The password for your redis instance (only applicable if using the redis socket store adapter)


### Advanced Configuration

These configuration options provide lower-level access to the underlying Socket.io server settings for complete customizability.

| Property   | Type      | Default  | Details |
|------------|-----------|----------|---------|
|`transports`|((array))  | `['websocket', 'htmlfile', 'xhr-polling', 'jsonp-polling']`     | A array of allowed transport methods which the clients will try to use. The flashsocket transport is disabled by default You can enable flashsockets by adding 'flashsocket' to this list. |
|`origins  ` |((string)) |`'*:*'`   |Match string representing the origins that are allowed to connect to the Socket.IO server|
|`heartbeats`         |((boolean))|`true`    |Sets whether we should use heartbeats to check the health of Socket.IO connections|
|`close timeout`      |((integer))|`60`   |When client closes connection, the number of seconds to wait before attempting a reconnect. This value is sent to the client after a successful handshake.|
|`heartbeat timeout`  |((integer))|`60`|The max number of seconds between heartbeats sent from the client to the server. This value is sent to the client after a successful handshake.|
|`heartbeat interval` |((integer))|`25`|The max number of seconds to wait for an expcted heartbeat before declaring the pipe broken. This number should be less than the `heartbeat timeout`|
|`polling duration`   |((integer))|`20`|The maximum duration of one HTTP poll; if it exceeds this limit it will be closed.|
|`flash policy server`|((boolean))|`true`|Enables the flash policy server if the flashsocket transport is enabled.|
|`flash policy port`  |((integer))|`10843`| TODO |
|`destroy buffer size`|((integer))|`10E7`| Used by the HTTP transports. The Socket.io server buffers HTTP request bodies up to this limit. This limit is not applied to websocket or flashsockets.|
|`destroy upgrade`    |((boolean))|`true`|Whether we need to destroy non-socket.io upgrade requests|
|`browser client`     |((boolean))|`true`|Whether Sails/Socket.io should serve the `socket.io.js` client (as well as WebSocketMain.swf for Flash sockets, etc.)|
|`browser client cache `|((boolean))|`true `|Whether to cache the Socket.io file generation in the memory of the process to speed up the serving of the static files.|
|`browser client minification`|((boolean))|`false`|Whether Socket.io needs to send a minified build of the static client script|
|`browser client etag`|((boolean))|`false`|Whether Socket.io needs to send an ETag header for the static requests|
|`browser client expires`|((integer))|`315360000`|TODO|
|`browser client gzip`|((boolean))|`false`|Whether Socket.io needs to GZIP the static files. This process is only done once and the computed output is stored in memory so we don&rsquo;t have to spawn a gzip process for each request.|
|`browser client handler`|((boolean))|`false`| Optional override function to serve all static files, including socket.io.js et al. Of the form :: `function (req, res) { /* serve files */ }`|
|`match origin protocol`|((boolean))|`false`|Meant to be used when running socket.io behind a proxy. Should be set to true when you want the location handshake to match the protocol of the origin. This fixes issues with terminating the SSL in front of Node and forcing location to think it&rsquo;s wss instead of ws.
|`authorization`|((boolean))|`false`|Global authorization for Socket.io access. This is called when the initial handshake is performed with the server. By default, Sails verifies that a valid cookie was sent with the upgrade request However, in the case of cross-domain requests, no cookies are sent for some transports, so sockets will fail to connect.  You might also just want to allow anyone to connect w/o a cookie! To bypass this cookie check, you can set `authorization: false`, which will silently create an anonymous cookie+session for the user. `authorization: true` indicates that Sails should use the built-in logic. You can also use your own custom logic with: `authorization: function (data, accept) { ... }`|
|`resource`|((string))|`'/socket.io'`|The entry point where Socket.io starts looking for incoming connections. This should be the same between the client and the server.|
