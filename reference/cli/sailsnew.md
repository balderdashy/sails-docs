# sails new

`sails new <appName>` creates a new Sails project in a folder called **appName**.

##### Options:

  * `--no-linker` Disable automatic asset linking in your view and static HTML files (the relevant grunt tasks will not be created)
  * `--no-frontend` Disable the generation of the `assets` folder and files. Views will be created with hardcopied linked resources  off of sailsjs.org.
  * `--template=[template language]` Use a different template language than the default (e.g. `jade`).  Requires that a views generator for that language (e.g. `sails-generate-views-jade`) be installed in your global node path (e.g. `~/node_modules/` works).

> `sails new` is really just a special [generator](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/Generators) which runs [`sails-generate-new`](http://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate-new).  In other words, running `sails new foo` is an alias for running `sails generate new foo`, and like any Sails generator, the actual generator module which gets run can be overridden in your global `~/.sailsrc` file.
