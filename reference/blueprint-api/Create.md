# Create a Record

Creates a new model instance in your database then returns it's values.

```
POST /:model
```


Attributes can be sent in the HTTP body as form-encoded values or JSON.

Responds with a JSON object representing the newly created instance.  If a validation error occurred, a JSON response with the invalid attributes and a `400` status code will be returned instead.

Additionally, a `create` event will be published to all listening sockets (see the docs for [.watch()](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/reference/ModelMethods.md#watchrequest) for more info).

If the action is triggered via a socket request, the requesting socket will ALSO be subscribed to the newly created model instance.  If the record is subsequently updated or deleted, a message will be sent to that socket's client informing them of the change. See the docs for .subscribe() for more info.

### Parameters


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

    <tr>
      <td><code>&#42;</code></td>
      <td>
        <bubble type="string" colors="bubble.color"></bubble>
        <br/>
        <bubble type="number" colors="bubble.color"></bubble>
        <br/>
        <bubble type="object" colors="bubble.color"></bubble>
        <br/>
        <bubble type="array" colors="bubble.color"></bubble>
      </td>
      <td>

        For <code>POST</code> (RESTful) requests, pass in body parameter with the same name as the attribute defined on your model to set those values on your new record.  For <code>GET</code> (shortcut) requests, add the parameters to the query string.
        Nested objects and arrays passed in as parameters are handled the same way as if they were passed into the model's <a>.create()</a> method.

### Examples

#### Create a record (REST)

Create a new pony named "AppleJack" with a hobby of "pickin".

#### Route
`POST /pony`



#### JSON Request Body
```json
{
  "name": "AppleJack",
  "hobby": "pickin"
}
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "name": "AppleJack",
  "hobby": "pickin",
  "id": 47,
  "createdAt": "2013-10-18T01:23:56.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2013-11-26T22:55:19.951Z"
}
```

#### Create a record (shortcuts)

#### Route
`GET /pony/create?name=Shutterfly&best_pony=yep`

#### Expected Response

```javascript
{
 "name": "Shutterfly",
 "best_pony": "yep",
 "createdAt": "2014-02-24T21:02:16.068Z",

 "id": 5
}

```


### Examples with One Way Associations

You can create associations between models in two different ways.  You can either make the association with a record that already exists OR you can create both records simultaneously.  Check out the examples to see how.

These examples assume the existence of `Pet` and `Pony` APIs which can be created by hand or using the [Sails CLI Tool](/#!documentation/reference/CommandLine/CommandLine.html).  The `Pony` model must be configured with a `pet` attribute pointing to the `Pet` model.  See [Model Association Docs](./ModelAssociations.md) for info on how to do this.

### Create record while associating w/ existing record (REST)

Create a new pony named "Pinkie Pie" and associate it with an existing pet named "Gummy" which has an `id` of 10.

#### Route
`POST /pony`

#### JSON Request Body
```json
{
  "name": "Pinkie Pie",
  "hobby": "ice skating",
  "pet": 10
}
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "name": "Pinkie Pie",
  "hobby": "ice skating",
  "pet": {
    "name": "Gummy",
    "species": "crocodile",
    "id": 10
  },
  "id": 4,
  "createdAt": "2013-10-18T01:22:56.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2013-11-26T22:54:19.951Z"
}
```


### Create new record while associating w/ another new record (REST)

Create a new pony named "Pinkie Pie", an "ice skating" hobby, and a new pet named "Gummy".

`POST /pony`


#### JSON Request Body
```json
{
  "name": "Pinkie Pie",

    "name": "Gummy",
    "species": "crocodile"
  }
}
