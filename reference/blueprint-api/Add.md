# Add to Collection

Adds an association between two records.

```
POST /:model/:record/:association/:record_to_add?
```

This action pushes a reference to some other record (the "foreign" record) onto a collection attribute of this record (the "primary" record).

+ If `:record_to_add` of an existing record is supplied, it will be associated with the primary record.
+ If no `:record_to_add` is supplied, and the body of the **POST** contains values for a new record, that record will be created and associated with the primary record.
+ If the collection within the primary record already contains a reference to the foreign record, this action will be ignored.
+ If the association is 2-way (i.e. reflexive, with "via" on both sides) the association on the foreign record will also be updated.


### Example

Add purchase 47 to the list of purchases that Dolly (employee #7) has been involved in.

**Using [jQuery](http://jquery.com/):**

```javascript
$.post('/employee/7/involvedInPurchases/47', function (purchases) {
  console.log(purchases);
});
```

**Using [Angular](https://angularjs.org/):**

```javascript
$http.post('/employee/7/involvedInPurchases/47')
.then(function (purchases) {
  console.log(purchases);
});
```

**Using [sails.io.js](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/websockets/sails.io.js):**

```javascript
io.socket.post('/employee/7/involvedInPurchases/47', function (purchases) {
  console.log(purchases);
});
```

**Using [cURL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL):**

```bash
curl http://localhost:1337/employee/7/involvedInPurchases/47 -X "POST"
```


Should return "Dolly", the primary record:

```json
{
  "involvedInPurchases": [
    {
      "amount": 10000,
      "createdAt": "2014-08-03T01:50:33.898Z",
      "updatedAt": "2014-08-03T01:51:08.227Z",
      "id": 47,
      "cashier": 7
    }
  ],
  "name": "Dolly",
  "createdAt": "2014-08-03T01:16:35.440Z",
  "updatedAt": "2014-08-03T01:51:41.567Z",
  "id": 7
}
```


### Notes

> + This action is for dealing with _plural_ ("collection") associations.  If you want to set or unset a _singular_ ("model") association, just use [update](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/blueprint-api/Update.html).
> + The example above assumes "rest" blueprints are enabled, and that your project contains at least an 'Employee' model with association: `involvedInPurchases: {collection: 'Purchase', via: 'cashier'}` as well as a `Purchase` model with association: `cashier: {model: 'Employee'}`.  You'll also need at least an empty `PurchaseController` and `EmployeeController`.  You can quickly achieve this by running:
>
>   ```shell
>   $ sails new foo
>   $ cd foo
>   $ sails generate api purchase
>   $ sails generate api employee
>   ```
>
> ...then editing `api/models/Purchase.js` and `api/models/Employee.js`.
