# Destroy a Record

Deletes an existing record specified by `id` from the database forever and returns the values of the deleted record.

```
DELETE /:model/:record
```

Destroys the model instance which matches the **id** parameter. Responds with a JSON object representing the newly destroyed instance. If no model instance exists matching the specified **id**, a `404` is returned.

Additionally, a `destroy` event will be published to all sockets subscribed to the instance room.

Consequently, all sockets currently subscribed to the instance will be unsubscribed from it.


### Parameters

 callback                           | ((string))                              | If specified, a JSONP response will be sent (instead of JSON).
