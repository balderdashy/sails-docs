# Remove from Collection

Removes an association between two records.

```
DELETE /:model/:record/:association/:record_to_remove
```

This action removes a reference to some other record (the "foreign" record) from a collection attribute of this record (the "primary" record).

+ If the foreign record does not exist, it is created first.
+ If the collection doesn't contain a reference to the foreign record, this action will be ignored.
+ If the association is 2-way (i.e. reflexive, with "via" on both sides) the association on the foreign record will also be updated.


### Example

Remove Dolly (employee #7) from the `employeesOfTheMonth` list of store #16.

**Using [jQuery](http://jquery.com/):**

```javascript
$.delete('/store/16/employeesOfTheMonth/7', function (purchases) {
  console.log(purchases);
});
```

**Using [Angular](https://angularjs.org/):**

```javascript
$http.delete('/store/16/employeesOfTheMonth/7')
.then(function (purchases) {
  console.log(purchases);
});
```

**Using [sails.io.js](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/websockets/sails.io.js):**

```javascript
io.socket.delete('/store/16/employeesOfTheMonth/7', function (purchases) {
  console.log(purchases);
});
```

**Using [cURL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL):**

```bash
curl http://localhost:1337/store/16/employeesOfTheMonth/7 -X "DELETE"
```


Should return store #16, the primary record:

```json
{
  "employeesOfTheMonth": [],
  "name": "Dolly",
  "createdAt": "2014-08-03T01:16:35.440Z",
  "updatedAt": "2014-08-03T01:51:41.567Z",
  "id": 16
}
```



### Notes

> + This action is for dealing with _plural_ ("collection") associations.  If you want to set or unset a _singular_ ("model") association, just use [update](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/blueprint-api/Update.html).
> + The example above assumes "rest" blueprints are enabled, and that your project contains at least an empty 'Employee' model as well as a `Store` model with association: `employeesOfTheMonth: {collection: 'Employee'}`.  You'll also need at least an empty `PurchaseController` and `EmployeeController`.  You can quickly achieve this by running:
>
>   ```shell
>   $ sails new foo
>   $ cd foo
>   $ sails generate api store
>   $ sails generate api employee
>   ```
>
> ...then editing `api/models/Store.js`.
