# Request (`req`)

Sails is built on [Express](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/PAGE_NEEDED.md), and uses [Node's HTTP server](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html) conventions.  Because of this, you can access all of the Node and Express methods and properties on the `req` object whereever it is accessible (i.e. in your controllers, policies, and custom responses.)

A nice side effect of this compatibility is that, in many cases, you can paste existing Node.js code into a Sails app and it will work.  And since Sails implements a transport-agnostic request interpreter, the code in your Sails app is WebSocket-compatible as well.

Sails adds a few methods and properties of its own to the `req` object, like [`req.wantsJSON`](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/req/req.wantsJSON.html) and [`req.params.all()`](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/req/req.allParams.html).  These features are syntactic sugar on top of the underlying implementation, and also support both HTTP and WebSockets.

### Protocol Support

The chart below describes support for the methods and properties on the Sails [Request](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/req) object (`req`) across multiple transports:
