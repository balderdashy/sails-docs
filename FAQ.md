# FAQ

### Where is the documentation?
+ [Docs for the latest stable npm release of Sails are on the website](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation)
+ This is mirrored by the [master branch of the `sails-docs` repo on github](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs)
  + The content in the Github repo is eventually pushed to the website.
  + It is usually a several commits ahead, and is the go-to place for the most up-to-date information.
  + This will become more automated as we're able to get more time to automate our tools (will open-source these asap post v0.10 release)

### What version of Sails should I use?

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sails)

The latest stable version in npm is always a safe bet (see the badge above.).  The latest stable npm release corresponds with the `stable` branch in the Sails repo.  Installing is easy- just follow the instructions in the README or on the Sails website (e.g. `npm install sails`.)

To install the beta/ pre-release version of Sails, install from the `beta` tag on npm (e.g. `npm install sails@beta`).  This is a great way to try out a coming release ahead of time and start upgrading before the release becomes official.  Except for extreme situations, the API in the release candidate should be consistent with the upcoming stable release it corresponds with.  The beta npm release candidate corresponds with the `beta` branch in the Sails repo.

Finally, if you like living on the edge, or you're working on adding a feature or fixing a bug in Sails, install the edge version from the `master` branch on github.  The edge version is not published on the registry since it's constantly under development, but you can _still use npm to install it_ (e.g. `npm install sails@git://github.com/balderdashy/sails.git`)

For more instructions on installing the stable, beta, and edge versions of Sails, check out the [contribution guide](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


### What are the dependencies of Sails?

[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/balderdashy/sails.png)](https://david-dm.org/balderdashy/sails)

Sails is maintained by [Balderdash](http://balderdash.co/), an interactive development studio in Austin, TX.  Heather and I started the company in 2012, on the promise that Node.js could be used to build production back-end applications from start to finish.  We created Sails to support that mission, and over 2 years later, the experiment has been a resounding success.  As you might expect, we do a lot of custom Sails+Node.js development, but our team has experience across the full stack, including: advanced interaction design, practical/scalable development of huge HTML 5 applications,  and building rich user experiences across many different devices and screen resolutions. We also provide training services for teams looking to increase their efficiency w/ Node.js.

# Getting Started With Sails

![image_squidhome@2x.png](http://i.imgur.com/m1vTk.png)

# Installation

> New to Node.js?  Get started by following the directions here: http://nodejs.org/

Once you have Node.js up and running, installing Sails is pretty dern easy.  Just type:
```sh
sudo npm install -g sails
```


# Creating a New Sails Project

Here's how you get off the ground:

```sh
# Create the app
sails new testProject

# cd into the new project
cd testProject

# Fire up the server
# (you have to run this from the root of your project)
sails lift
```


# Creating a Model
Creating a model is very easy with the command line tool. You can even define attributes and their
type by adding arguments at the end of the command. To generate a User model, enter the following:
```
sails generate model User
```

You will see that this creates a user model at **/api/models/User.js**.  Let's give her a name-- try uncommenting the name attribute so it looks more or less like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
        attributes      : {
                name: 'STRING'
        }

};
```

# What's Better Than Scaffolding?  How About a JSON API?

Sails API scaffolding is nothing like Rails scaffolding. HTML scaffolds just don't make sense for
modern web apps! Instead, Sails automatically builds a RESTful JSON API for your models. Best of
all, it supports HTTP _and_ WebSockets! By default for every controller you create, you get the
basic CRUD operations created automatically.

For instance, after generating the User model above, if you visit `http://localhost:1337/user/create`, you'll see:
```json
{
  "createdAt": "2013-01-10T01:33:19.105Z",
  "updatedAt": "2013-01-10T01:33:19.105Z",
  "id": 1
}
```

That's it!  You just created a model in the database!  You can also `find`, `update`, and `destroy` users:

```
# List of all users
http://localhost:1337/user

# Find the user with id 1
http://localhost:1337/user/1

# Create a new user
http://localhost:1337/user/create
(or send an HTTP POST to http://localhost:1337/user)

# Update the user with id 1
http://localhost:1337/user/update/1
(or send an HTTP PUT to http://localhost:1337/user/1)

# Destroy the user with id 1
http://localhost:1337/user/destroy/1
(or send an HTTP DELETE to http://localhost:1337/user/1)
```

# Security
You can control access to your application's endpoints using policies.  See: https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/wiki/Policies

## Using https
HTTPS works the same way in Sails as it does in Express.  Drop your certificate and key file into your project, then configure the path to them.  For example, if you put your cert and key in a directory called `ssl` in the root of your project, you'd want to add the following to your `config/application.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports.ssl = {
  cert : fs.readFileSync(sails.config.appPath+'/ssl/combined.crt'),
  key  : fs.readFileSync(sails.config.appPath+'/ssl/yoursite.com.key')
};
```
