# tasks/pipeline.js

The `pipeline.js` file in your Sails app determines the order in which your stylesheets,
JavaScript, and client-side template files should be compiled and linked as `<script>`
or `<link>` tags.

If you are not relying on [automatic asset linking](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/assets/task-automation#?asset-pipeline), then you can safely ignore this file.

> Note that you can take advantage of Grunt-style wildcard/glob/splat expressions for matching multiple files, and use `!` in front of an expression to ignore files.
