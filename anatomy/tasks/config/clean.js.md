# tasks/config/clean.js

This file configures a Grunt task called "clean".

This task is used when preparing for a new pass through the asset pipeline. Its job is to remove any existing temporary files and folders in your Sails app's web root.

> (By default, the [web root in a Sails app](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/assets) is a hidden directory called `.tmp/public`.)

For additional usage documentation, see [`grunt-contrib-clean`](https://npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-clean).
