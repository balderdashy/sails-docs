# myApp/assets/js/dependencies/sails.io.js
### Purpose

This file adds a few custom methods to socket.io which provide the "built-in" websockets functionality for Sails.

Specifically, those methods allow you to send and receive Socket.IO messages to & from Sails by simulating a REST client interface on top of Socket.IO. It models it's API after the $.ajax pattern from jQuery which you might be familiar with.
