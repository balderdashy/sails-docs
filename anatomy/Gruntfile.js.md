# Gruntfile.js


Sails uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for asset management. This file contains the entry point for the default asset pipeline in Sails; that is, the code that does stuff like compiling LESS stylesheets, minifying scripts for production, and precompiling and injecting client-side templates.

Sails' integration with Grunt is fully customizable, but for most use cases, this file (`Gruntfile.js`) should remain unchanged.  Instead, you can install Grunt plugins or add your own custom logic as new files in the [`tasks/`](./tasks) folder.
