# views/500.ejs

This is the default "500: Server Error" page. User agents that don't "Accept" HTML will see a JSON version instead.

You can customize the control logic for your needs in `config/500.js` Sails considers a request in a "500: Server Error" state when your app throws a catchable error (not inside of an asynchronous callback).

You can also trigger this response from one of your controllers or policies with: `return res.serverError( e );` (where `e` is an optional message, error, or array of errors to include in the response).
