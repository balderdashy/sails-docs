# api/models/

This is the directory that holds your models.  In Sails, models are the structures that contain data for your Sails App.

You can learn more about how to define and use models in [Concepts > Models and ORM > Models](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/models), and about how to generate them [here](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/command-line-interface/sails-generate#?core-generators).
