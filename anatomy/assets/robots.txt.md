# assets/robots.txt
### Purpose
This file tells search engines and roving packs of robot spiders about whether or not the content in your app should be indexed.

You can read more about robots.txt [here](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html), or about how it is parsed by Google [here](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608).




```
# The robots.txt file is used to control how search engines index your live URLs.
# See http://sailsjs.org/documentation/anatomy/my-app/assets/robots-txt for more information.



# To prevent search engines from seeing the site altogether, uncomment the next two lines:
# User-Agent: *
# Disallow: /

```
