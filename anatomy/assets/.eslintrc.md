# assets/.eslintrc

This file is for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration overrides for  the `assets/` directory.

These override the code conventions defined in the top-level [`.eslintrc`](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/anatomy/.eslintrc), to allow for variations between front-end JavaScript code vs. backend code designed to run in a Node.js/Sails process.
