# config/custom

This is your custom configuration file. It is useful for one-off settings specific to your application-- things like the domain to use when sending emails, or 3rd party API keys for Stripe, Mailgun, Twitter, Facebook, etc.

> Use `sails.config.custom` to access these values from your actions and helpers.

You can learn more about custom configuration [here](http://sailsjs.com/docs/concepts/configuration#?custom-configuration).
