# config/custom

This is your custom configuration file. It is useful for one-off settings specific to your application-- like your base URL for linkbacks, the no-reply "From" address to use when sending automated emails, or 3rd party API keys for Stripe, Mailgun, Twilio, etc.

> Use [`sails.config.custom`](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/application/sails-config-custom) to access these values from your actions and helpers.
