# Sails.js User Guides
### Guides

> This will be a top level documentation section on the sails.js website as soon as we get a little more content for it.

Sails.js was created by the Balderdash team out of necessity in order to quickly and efficiently make rock solid apps for our clients.  We then open sourced it so others could do the same.  Client work is still what pays the bills at Balderdash and while we love to work on Sails full time, we just can't.  This section is part of an ongoing effort to further open up the Sails.js framework to the community and keep Balderdash from constraining it's growth.

#### How can you help?
Think about how you have used Sails for your project then write a guide about it!

#### What should I write about?
- If you have a less than common use case, write a guide about it.
- If you had a hard time finding a solution to a particular problem while using Sails, write a guide describing your workaround.
- Are you doing something unconventional with Sails?  Write a guide.
- Are you using Sails for your embedded hardware project?  Please, for the love of God, write a guide!

#### Okay, I'll do it! Now what?

Thanks.  You're awesome!  Now, before you write anything, see the very first user guide in this folder under [contributing.md](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/userguides/contributing.md)

#### Legal Disclaimer

Just kidding about the legal disclaimer.  Seriously though, thank you for contibuting.  If it weren't for the help of folks like you, this project wouldn't be half of what it is today.  You guys rock.

#### Sincerely and Truly
Nick (@uncletammy)
