# Creating a Project Hook

Project hooks are custom Sails hooks that reside in an application&rsquo;s `api/hooks` folder.  They are typically useful when you want to take advantage of hook features like [defaults](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/Hooks/hookspec/defaults.html) and [routes](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/Hooks/hookspec/routes.html) for code that is used by multiple components in a single app.  If you wish to re-use a hook in *more than one* Sails app, see [creating an installable hook](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/Hooks/installablehooks.html) instead.

To create a new project hook:

1. Choose a name for your new hook.  It must not conflict with any of the [core hook names](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/lib/app/configuration/default-hooks.js).
2. Create a folder with that name in your app&rsquo;s `api/hooks` folder.
3. Add an `index.js` file to that folder.
4. Write your hook code in `index.js` in accordance with the [hook specification](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/Hooks/hookspec).

Your new folder may contain other files as well, which can be loaded in your hook via `require`; only `index.js` will be read automatically by Sails.

As an alternative to a folder, you may create a file in your app&rsquo;s `api/hooks` folder like `api/hooks/myProjectHook.js`.

#### Testing that your hook loads properly

To test that your hook is being loaded by Sails, lift your app with `sails lift --verbose`.  If your hook is loaded, you will see a message like:

`verbose: your-hook-name hook loaded successfully.`

in the logs.
