# Creating an Installable Hook

Installable hooks are custom Sails hooks that reside in an application&rsquo;s `node_modules` folder.  They are useful when you want to share functionality between Sails apps, or publish your hook to [NPM](http://npmjs.org) to share it with the Sails community.  If you wish to create a hook for use in  *just one* Sails app, see [creating a project hook](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/Hooks/projecthooks.html) instead.

To create a new installable hook:

1. Choose a name for your new hook.  It must not conflict with any of the [core hook names](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/lib/app/configuration/default-hooks.js).
1. Create a new folder on your system with the name `sails-hook-<your hook name>`.  The `sails-hook-` prefix is optional but recommended for consistency; it is stripped off by Sails when the hook is loaded.
1. Create a `package.json` file in the folder.  If you have `npm` installed on your system, you can do this easily by running `npm init` and following the prompts.  Otherwise, you can create the file manually, and ensure that it contains at a minimum the following:
```
{
    "name": "sails-hook-your-hook-name",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "description": "a brief description of your hook",
    "main": "index.js",
    "sails": {
      "isHook": true
    }
}
```
If you use `npm init` to create your `package.json`, be sure to open the file afterwards and manually insert the `sails` key containing `isHook: true`.
1. Write your hook code in `index.js` in accordance with the [hook specification](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/hooks/hook-specification).

Your new folder may contain other files as well, which can be loaded in your hook via `require`; only `index.js` will be read automatically by Sails.  Use the `dependencies` key of your `package.json` to refer to any dependencies that need to be installed in order for your hook to work (you may also use `npm install <dependency> --save` to easily save dependency information to `package.json`).

### Testing your new hook

Before you distribute your installable hook to others, you&rsquo;ll want to write some tests for it.  This will help ensure compatibility with future Sails versions and significantly reduce hair-pulling and destruction of nearby objects in fits of rage.  While a full guide to writing tests is outside the scope of this doc, the following steps should help get you started:

1. Add Sails as a `devDependency` in your hook&rsquo;s `package.json` file:
```
"devDependencies": {
      "sails": "~0.11.0"
}
```
1. Install Sails as a dependency of your hook with `npm install sails` or `npm link sails` (if you have Sails installed globally on your system).
1. Install [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) on your system with `npm install -g mocha`, if you haven&rsquo;t already.
1. Add a `test` folder inside your hook&rsquo;s main folder.
2. Add a `basic.js` file with the following basic test:
```
	var Sails = require('sails').Sails;

	describe('Basic tests ::', function() {

        // Var to hold a running sails app instance
		var sails;

        // Before running any tests, attempt to lift Sails
		before(function (done) {

			// Hook will timeout in 10 seconds
			this.timeout(11000);

			// Attempt to lift sails
		    Sails().lift({
		      hooks: {
		        // Load the hook
		        "your-hook-name": require('../'),
		        // Skip grunt (unless your hook uses it)
		        "grunt": false
		      },
		      log: {level: "error"}
		    },function (err, _sails) {
		      if (err) return done(err);
		      sails = _sails;
		      return done();
		    });
		});

        // After tests are complete, lower Sails
		after(function (done) {

			// Lower Sails (if it successfully lifted)
			if (sails) {
				return sails.lower(done);
			}
			// Otherwise just return
			return done();
		});

		// Test that Sails can lift with the hook in place
		it ('sails does not crash', function() {
			return true;
		});

	});
```
1. Run the test with `mocha -R spec` to see full results.
1. See the [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) docs for a full reference.

### Publishing your hook

Assuming your hook is tested and looks good, and assuming that the hook name isn&rsquo;t already in use by another [NPM](http://npmjs.org) module, you can share it with world by running `npm publish`.  Go you!
