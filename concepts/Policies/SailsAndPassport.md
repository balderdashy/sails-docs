# Authentication and Permissioning with Sails + Passport

Passport works great with Sails!  In general, since Sails uses Connect/Express at its core, all of the Connect/Express-oriented things work pretty well.  In fact, Sails has no problem interpreting most Express middleware to work with socket.io.
