# Hosting

Here is a non-comprehensive list of Sails.js hosting providers.

##### Deploying to Modulus?

##### Deploying to NodeJitsu?
To deploy to NodeJitsu, you'll need to make some minor modifications to your configuration:
Open up `config/local.js` in your app folder. In here, you'll need to add the following lines.

```
    // Port this Sails application will live on
	port: 80,
	host: 'subdomain.jit.su',
```

The `host:` is new to the file and is not created by default.  You will need to add this.  Nodejitsu will ask you for the `subdomain` when you run `jitsu deploy`

##### Deploying to OpenShift?
To deploy to OpenShift, you'll need to make some minor modifications to your configuration:
Open up `config/local.js` in your app folder. In here, you'll need to add the following lines.

```
	port: process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT,
	host: process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP,
```

You will also need to install `grunt-cli` with `npm i --save grunt-cli`.

After doing that, create the file `.openshift/action_hooks/pre_start_nodejs` with the following contents. ([source](https://gist.github.com/mdunisch/4a56bdf972c2f708ccc6))

```
#!/bin/bash
export NODE_ENV=production

if [ -f "${OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR}"/Gruntfile.js ]; then
    (cd "${OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR}"; node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt prod)
fi
```

Then create the file `/supervisor_opts` with the following contents. This tells OpenShift's supervisor to ignore Sails' `.tmp` directory for the hot reload functionality. ([source](https://gist.github.com/mdunisch/4a56bdf972c2f708ccc6#comment-1318102))

```
-i .tmp
```

You can now `git add . && git commit -a -m "your message" && git push` to deploy to OpenShift.

##### Getting professional help

These days, it's getting easier and easier to deploy powerful applications at scale.  That said, there isn't always time to do these things yourself.
Sails.js is maintained by my company, [Balderdash](http://balderdash.co), a Node.js consultancy in Austin, TX. If your company needs professional support, reach out and we're happy to help.  The deployment part really isn't that hard, and in most cases, it shouldn't take more than a couple of hours tops.
