# Disabling Grunt

To disable Grunt integration in Sails, simply delete your Gruntfile (and/or [`tasks/`](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/anatomy/myApp/tasks) folder). You can also disable the Grunt hook. Just set the `grunt` property to `false` in `.sailsrc` hooks like this:

```json
{
    "hooks": {
        "grunt": false
    }
}
```

### Can I customize this for SASS, Angular, client-side Jade templates, etc?

Yep! Just replace the relevant grunt task in your `tasks/` directory, or add a new one.  Like [SASS](https://github.com/sails101/using-sass) for example.

If you still want to use Grunt for other purposes, but don't want any of the default web front-end stuff, just delete your project's assets folder and remove the front-end oriented tasks from the `grunt/register/` and `grunt/config/` folders.  You can also run `sails new myCoolApi --no-frontend` to omit the assets folder and front-end-oriented Grunt tasks for future projects.  You can also replace your `sails-generate-frontend` module with alternative community generators, or [create your own](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate-generator).  This allows `sails new` to create the boilerplate for native iOS apps, Android apps, Cordova apps, SteroidsJS apps, etc.
