# To v0.11

v0.11 comes with many minor improvements, as well as some internal cleanup in core. The biggest change is that Sails core is now using Socket.io v1.

Almost none of this should affect the existing code in project, but there are a few important differences and new features to be aware of. See the [full migration guide](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/0.11-migration-guide.md) for details on how to upgrade.
