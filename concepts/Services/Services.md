# Services

Services can be thought of as libraries which contain functions that you might want to use in many places of your application.  For example, you might have an EmailService which wraps some default email message boilerplate code that you would want to use in many parts of your application. The main benefit of using services in Sails is that they are *globalized*--you don't have to use `require()` to access them.
