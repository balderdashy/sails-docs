# Attributes
### Overview

Model attributes are basic pieces of information about a model.  For example, a model called `Person` might have attributes named `firstName`, `lastName`, `phoneNumber`, `age`, `birthDate` and `emailAddress`.

FUTURE: address sql vs. no sql and stuff like:
"""
In most cases, this data is _homogenous_, meaning each record has the same attributes,
"""
-->



### Defining attributes

A model's `attributes` [setting](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/model-settings) allows you to provide a set of attributes, each defined as a dictionary (a plain JavaScript object):

```javascript
// api/models/User.js
{
  attributes: {
    emailAddress: { type: 'string', required: true, },
    karma: { type: 'number', },
    isSubscribedToNewsletter: { type: 'boolean', defaultsTo: true, },
  },
}
```

Within each attribute, there are one or more keys&mdash;or options&mdash;which are used to provide additional direction to Sails and Waterline.  These attribute keys tell the model how to go about ensuring type safety, enforcing high-level validation rules, and (if you have automigrations enabled) how it should go about setting up tables or collections in your database.


##### Default attributes

You can also define default attributes that will appear in _all_ of your models, by defining `attributes` as a [default model setting](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/model-settings) (e.g. in `config/models.js`).  For example, new Sails apps come with three default attributes out of the box: `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.

These attributes will be available in all models unless they are overridden or disabled.  To override a default attribute, define an attribute with the same name in the model definition.  To _disable_ a default attribute, define it as `false`.  For instance, to disable the default `updatedAt` attribute for a particular model:

```javascript
// api/models/ProductCategory.js
module.exports = {
  attributes: {
    updatedAt: false,
    label: { type: 'string', required: true },
  }
}
```



### Type safety


##### Type

Except for [associations](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/associations), every attribute must declare a `type`.

This is the type of data that will be stored for this attribute and used for logical type safety checks of queries and results.  Here is a list of the data types supported by Sails and Waterline:

- string
- number
- boolean
- json
- ref



##### Required

If an attribute is `required: true`, then a value must always be specified for it when calling `.create()`.  This prevents the attribute value from being created as or updated to `null` or empty string ("").


##### Default values

In addition to the five data types, there are a couple of other basic guarantees that you can define for an attribute; one of these is the ability to assign it a default value.

The default value (`defaultsTo`) of an attribute only applies on `.create()`, and only when the key is omitted entirely.


```javascript
attributes: {
  phoneNumber: {
    type: 'string',
    defaultsTo: '111-222-3333'
  }
}
```

##### Allow Null

The `string`, `number`, and `boolean` data types do _not_ accept `null` as a value when creating or updating records.  In order to allow a `null` value to be set, you can toggle the `allowNull` flag on the attribute. Note that the `allowNull` flag is only valid on the data types listed above. It is _not_ valid on attributes with types `json` or `ref`, any associations, or any primary key attributes.


```javascript
attributes: {
  phoneNumber: {
    type: 'string',
    allowNull: true
  }
}
```

### Validations

In addition to basic type safety checks, Sails offers several different high-level validation rules.  For example, the `isIn` rule verifies that any new value stored for this attribute must _exactly match_ one of a few different hard-coded constants:

```javascript
unsubscribeReason: {
  type: 'string',
  isIn: ['boring', 'too many emails', 'recipes too difficult', 'other'],
  required: true
}
```

For a complete list of high-level validation rules, see [Validations](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/validations).

### columnName

Inside an attribute definition, you can specify a `columnName` to force Sails/Waterline to store data for that attribute in a specific column in the configured datastore (i.e. database).  Be aware that this is not necessarily SQL-specific&mdash;it will also work for MongoDB fields, etc.

While the `columnName` property is primarily designed for working with existing/legacy databases, it can also be useful in situations where your database is being shared by other applications, or those in which you don't have access permissions to change the schema.

To store/fetch your model's `numberOfWheels` attribute into/from the `number_of_round_rotating_things` column:
```javascript
  // An attribute in one of your models:
  // ...
  numberOfWheels: {
    type: 'number',
    columnName: 'number_of_round_rotating_things'
  }
  // ...
```


Now for a more comprehensive example.

Let's say you have a `User` model in your Sails app that looks like this:

```javascript
// api/models/User.js
module.exports = {
  datastore: 'shinyNewMySQLDatabase',
  attributes: {
    name: {
      type: 'string'
    },
    password: {
      type: 'string'
    },
    email: {
      type: 'string',
      unique: true
    }
  }
};
```


Everything works great, but instead of using an existing MySQL database sitting on a server somewhere that happens to house your app's intended users...

```javascript
// config/datastores.js
module.exports = {
  // ...

  // Existing users are in here!
  rustyOldMySQLDatabase: {
    adapter: 'sails-mysql',
    url: 'mysql://ofh:Gh19R!?@db.eleven.sameness.foo/jonas'
  },
  // ...
};
```

... let's say there's a table called `our_users` in the old MySQL database that looks like this:

| the_primary_key | email_address | full_name | seriously_hashed_password|
|------|---|----|---|
| 7 | mike@sameness.foo | Mike McNeil | ranchdressing |
| 14 | nick@sameness.foo | Nick Crumrine | thousandisland |


In order to use this from Sails, you'd change your `User` model to look like this:

```javascript
// api/models/User.js
module.exports = {
  datastore: 'rustyOldMySQLDatabase',
  tableName: 'our_users',
  attributes: {
    id: {
      type: 'number',
      unique: true,
      columnName: 'the_primary_key'
    },
    name: {
      type: 'string',
      columnName: 'full_name'
    },
    password: {
      type: 'string',
      columnName: 'seriously_hashed_password'
    },
    email: {
      type: 'string',
      unique: true,
      columnName: 'email_address'
    }
  }
};
```

> You might have noticed that we also used the [`tableName`](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/model-settings#?tablename) property in this example.  This allows us to control the name of the table that will be used to house our data.


### Encryption at rest

##### encrypt

Setting `encrypt` allows you to decide whether this attribute should be automatically encrypted. If set to `true`, when a record is retrieved, it will still contain the encrypted value for this attribute unless [`.decrypt()`](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/waterline-orm/queries/decrypt) is used.

```javascript
attributes: {
  ssn: {
    type: 'string',
    encrypt: true
  }
}
```
> If you're using `encrypt: true` for an attribute, you won't be able to look up records by the unencrypted value.




### Automigrations

These settings are used to indicate how Sails should create the physical-level (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL or MongoDB) database field for an attribute when an app is lifted.

> When a model&rsquo;s `migrate` property is set to `safe`, these settings will be ignored and the database columns will remain unchanged.

##### columnType

Indicates the type of physical-level column data type to use for an attribute when Sails creates the database table. This allows you to specify types that are tied directly to how your underlying database will create them. For example, you may have an attribute that sets its `type` property to `number` and to store that in the database you want to use the column type `float`. Your attribute definition would look like:

```javascript
attributes: {
  placeInLine: {
    type: 'number',
    columnType: 'float'
  }
}
```

> * Column types are entirely database-dependent.  Be sure that the `columnType` you select corresponds to a data type that is valid for your database!  If you don&rsquo;t specify a `columnType`, the adapter will choose one for you based on the attribute&rsquo;s `type`.
> * The `columnType` value is used verbatim in the statement that creates the database column, so you can use it to specify additional options, e.g. `varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4`.
> * If you intend to store binary data in a Sails model, you&rsquo;ll want to set the `type` of the attribute to `ref`, and then use the appropriate `columnType` for your chosen database (e.g. `mediumblob` for MySQL or `bytea` for PostgreSQL).  Keep in mind that whatever you attempt to store will have to fit in memory before being transferred to the database, as there is currently no mechanism in Sails for streaming binary data to a datastore adapter.  As an alternative to storing blobs in a database, you might consider streaming them to disk or to a remote filesystem like S3, using the [`.upload()` method](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/file-uploads).
> * Keep in mind that custom column options like `CHARACTER SET utf8mb4` in MySQL can affect a column&rsquo;s storage size. This is especially relevant when used in conjunction with the `unique` property, where you may have to specify a smaller column size to avoid errors.  See the [`unique` property](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/attributes#?unique) docs below for more info.

##### autoIncrement

Sets up the attribute as an auto-increment key.  When a new record is added to the model, if a value for this attribute is not specified, it will be generated by incrementing the most recent record's value by one. Note: attributes that specify `autoIncrement` should always be of `type: 'number'`. Also bear in mind that the level of support varies across different datastores. For instance, MySQL will not allow more than one auto-incrementing column per table.

```javascript
attributes: {
  placeInLine: {
    type: 'number',
    autoIncrement: true
  }
}
```

##### unique

Ensures no two records will be allowed with the same value for the target attribute. This is an adapter-level constraint, so in most cases this will result in a unique index on the attribute being created in the underlying datastore.

```javascript
attributes: {
  username: {
    type: 'string',
    unique: true
  }
}
```
> When using `unique: true` on an attribute with the `utf8mb4` character set in a MySQL database, you will need to set the column size manually via the [`columnType` property](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/attributes#?columntype) to avoid a possible 'index too long' error.  For example: `columnType: varchar(100) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4`.


### Documenting Attributes

The following properties may be used to document model attributes.

For example:

```javascript
attributes: {
  username: {
    type: 'string',
    description: 'Unique username for this user.',
    extendedDescription: `
      Username must be unique, may only contain alphanumeric characters and must start with a letter.
      
      They are **optional** as users may use their email address to sign in.
      `,
    moreInfoUrl: 'https://docs.website.com/all-about-usernames',
    example: 'johnsmith'
  }
}
```

##### description

The `description` property may be used to provide a short text description of the attribute. 
Generally, it should be limited to ≤140 characters.

##### extendedDescription

The `extendedDescription` property should be used to provide an extended description of the attribute.
In typical use cases this may include markdown e.g. where the model definitions are used to
generate [OpenAPI/Swagger](https://swagger.io/) documentation.

##### moreInfoUrl

The `moreInfoUrl` property should be used to provide a link to an external reference containing 
more information in relation to the attribute.

##### example

The `example` property should be used to provide an example value for the attribute.
This may be any JSON value that is consistent with the attributes `type`.


### Custom Properties

When Waterline validates models at startup, it will report errors if invalid properties are
set for attributes. In order to customize/extend Sails, the `meta` property may be used.

For example:

```javascript
attributes: {
  username: {
    type: 'string',
    meta: {
      search: true, //< include this attribute in generic search index
      defaultSort: 'asc', //< when no sort specified, use this attribute in ascending order
    }
  }
}
```
