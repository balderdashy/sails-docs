# Sails.js Projects

This is the content for the page showcasing projects built with Sails. (This page is not yet implemented on sailsjs.org, but will be once we've gathered up enough projects.)

If you want to submit a project for this page, send a pull request adding a new file to this folder called [your-project-name].md. The formatting of the page should follow the [example template](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/projects/project-template.md), which has the following:

+ Screenshot/image/logo to represent your project. (Screenshots are preferable, though.) The dimensions should be ___ x ___. [TODO: figure out dimensions. Probably like 600x400]
+ h2 with your project's title that also links to your project.
+ A brief description of your project, around 125 characters long.
